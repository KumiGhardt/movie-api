    <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
    <p>
        To build the server­side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will
        provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users
        will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
        movies.

    <h4>Optional Features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Allow users to see which actors star in which movies</li>
        <li> Allow users to view information about different actors</li>
        <li> Allow users to view more information about different movies, such as the release date
            and the movie rating</li>
        <li>Allow users to create a “To Watch” list in addition to their “Favorite Movies” list</li>
    </ul>

        <li> The API must provide movie information in JSON format.</li>
        <li> The JavaScript code must be error­free.</li>
        <li> The API must be tested in Postman.</li>
        <li> The API must include user authentication and authorization code.</li>
        <li> The API must include data validation logic.</li>
        <li> The API must meet data security regulations.</li>
        <li> The API source code must be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub.</li>
        <li> The API must be deployed to Heroku.</li>
